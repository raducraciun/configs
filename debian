1) User meegal was not able to use sudo command
Corrected by :
	- escalating to super user
	$ su
	- adding user to sudoers group
	$ sudo adduser meegal sudo

2) Desktop folder was displayed by default by LXQt although unused.
Disabled it by :
	- editing ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs and chaning XDG_DESKTOP_DIR value to $HOME (instead of $HOME/Desktop)
